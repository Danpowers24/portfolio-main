            		You will often find me  watching car and tech videos, catching the game, or listening to music. I am very interested in the electric car movement. I drive (and adore) my 6-speed Subaru WRX and enjoy shifting through the gears, but electric cars are the future. I believe the sky's the limit for the crazy EV's that car manufacturers will produce in the coming years. <br><br>

            		Despite being a massive New England Patriots fan having grown up a town over from Foxboro, I have much more fun rooting for my mom's team - the Green Bay Packers. <br><br>

            		Staying up to date on all the latest consumer technology is an obsession of mine. I am always looking out for the latest and greatest cell phones, laptops, and televisions (despite not being able to afford any of them). <br><br>

            		When driving people around, I usually play people my pop and hip hop playlists while keeping the alternative and heavy metal stuff to myself. I love playing the drums because it's a rewarding way to express myself. <br><br>

            		I was born and raised in a town called Mansfield. Mansfield is known for being the home of the Xfinity Center - a large, outdoor concert venue. It was a great place to grow up.
            			<br><br>
            		I eventually left home to attend Westfield State University. WSU is a wonderful little state school in western Massachusetts where I came out of my shell and found my own as the captain of the Ultimate Frisbee team and the chapter chairman of MASSPIRG, a student activism group on campus.
            			<br><br>
            		After graduating, I pounded the pavement doing door-to-door marketing for a home remodeling company. It was a tough job, but they flew the company to Cancun every year for the holiday party. The third and final holiday party I attended was the trip that my girlfriend and I got together on. I'm forever grateful for that last trip!
            			<br><br>
            		I moved to Brighton to be closer to my girlfriend, Caroline. I have really enjoyed my time living there - What a great place to live! I am now embarking on the next journey of my life to become a software engineer. I am attending bootcamp to learn and equip myself with new tools to take on new challenges. There are lots of fun problems in the tech world that I want to learn how to solve! <br><br>
